# Lesson 01: Introduction to Bash Scripting

## Overview

This lesson introduces the fundamentals of bash scripting and expect for automation. You'll learn how to write shell scripts to automate repetitive tasks and use expect to handle interactive command-line programs automatically.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** what bash scripting is and when to use it for automation
2. **Identify** tasks in your workflow that can be automated with shell scripts
3. **Write** basic bash scripts to automate file operations and system tasks
4. **Use** expect scripts to automate interactive command-line programs
5. **Execute** and debug shell scripts effectively

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with using a terminal/command line
- Text editor installed (VS Code, Sublime, nano, vim, or any preferred editor)
- Unix-based system (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows)
- Bash shell available (usually pre-installed)
- Expect installed (install with: `sudo apt-get install expect` or `brew install expect`)
