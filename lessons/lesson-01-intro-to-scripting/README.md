# Lesson 01: Introduction to Scripting

## Overview

This lesson introduces the fundamentals of scripting and automation. You'll learn what scripting is, why it's useful in research, and how to write your first scripts to automate repetitive tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** what scripting is and how it differs from traditional programming
2. **Identify** tasks in your workflow that can be automated with scripts
3. **Write** basic scripts in Python or Bash to automate simple tasks
4. **Execute** scripts from the command line
5. **Debug** common scripting errors

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with using a terminal/command line
- Text editor installed (VS Code, Sublime, or any preferred editor)
- Python 3.x installed (or Bash for Unix-based systems)
